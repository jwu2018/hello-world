Hullo

My name is a name. I am a human. I enjoy doing activites necessary for human survival such as:
  - eating food
  - drinking water
  - sleeping
  - breathing
  - blinking
  - salivating
  - cleansing myself
  - talking to friends
  - talking to people who are not friends because it is deemed socially appropriate or necessary for school
  - homework (not really)
  - etc.
